Sooo this is supposed to be an F/OSS android app which makes gifs on the fly from images on the phone. While it essentially *does* that, it doesn't work so well. There are many problems. Many.


## Roadmap

### Immediate
1. Select multiple images for bitmaps frames
2. Enter in File name
3. Compress files
3. Clear Bitmaps array
5. Async gif creation..?
4. Dynamic gridview of bitmaps

### Preferences
1. Delay defaults
2. Repeat defaults
3. Size defaults

### Viewing
1. View gifs?
   - Use glide?
2. create gif folder?

#### Things I've accomplished that I list in order to make myself feel good
- image compression
