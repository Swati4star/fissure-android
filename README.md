## Roadmap

### Immediate

3. ~~Move edittext above button~~
4. ~~Explain to press for preview~~
5. ~~Change list view titles~~
6. ~~Hide N/A Menu Items~~
7. Instructions Activity
8. French Translation

### Eventually
6. Dynamic gridview of bitmaps
2. Fancy ListView
8. Preferences
 - sample size

9. Instructions Activity
10. Screen Lock
11. Make the listview have decent names of the selected frames
12. Delete individual frames from listview
13. Share button
14. Upload
15. Translation

### Instructions
